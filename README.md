# Kannada-MNIST---Classification-Problem
# Problem Statement
The task is to build a machine learning model capable of correctly classifying grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9) and this is an extension to the classic MNIST dataset where we deal with the Kannada Numerals. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in correctly identifying the digits using various classification algorithms and techniques. The dataset that is used can be referred from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/higgstachyon/kannada-mnist

# Libraries Used
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib


# Approach
1.Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Extracting the dataset from the provided npz file, containing 60,000 training and 10,000 test images, each with a size of 28x28 pixels.
Normalizing the pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 and reshape the images for further processing.
Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:

2.Performing PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the image dimensions from 28x28 to a compact 10-dimensional representation.
Retaining the most important features while reducing computational complexity.
Model Selection and Training:

3.Implementing five powerful classification models: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-NN Classifier, and SVM.
Train each model using the transformed training data in 10 dimensions.
Model Evaluation and Metrics:

4.Evaluating the performance of each model using essential metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
Generating Confusion Matrix to analyze the accuracy of predictions for all classes.
Visualizing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (RoC) curve to gauge model performance.
